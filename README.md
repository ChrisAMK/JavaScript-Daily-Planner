For the weeks homework we are tasked to create a Work Day Scheduler that tracks all the tasks in the users day, stores then to Local Storage so that when the page is refreshed, the Tasks stay put. At first the task looked to be quite complicated but once the layout was done it was all good. The main task was to have the user input texts, then grab that text and put it into local storage, also display any current text that is in the Local Storage. They are many ways to store into Local storage but considering it was just one string, i didn't bother with objects, or JSON.

Moment JS is quite handy to use, i intend on going back to last weeks homework and redoing it using moment.js
